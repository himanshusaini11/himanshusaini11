## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Data scientist with 4+ years of computational research and recent applied ML experience. Built and shipped a real-time computer-vision system running 10–15 FPS on device and trained high-recall models for semiconductor yield and credit- risk prediction. Strengths in rare-event classification and cost-sensitive evaluation, with proven results: ~75% recall in manufacturing yield and ~77% in credit risk.

## SKILLS

Programming: Python, SQL, Bash, MATLAB ML/Stats: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Cross-Validation, Calibration, Class Imbalance (SMOTE, NearMiss), SHAP AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Deep Learning Data Skills: Data Wrangling, EDA, ETL, Data Modeling, A/B Testing LLMs & Agents: Agentic system design, LLMs (StarCoder2-3B, CodeLlama-7B) MLOps: FastAPI, Docker, CI-ready workflows Visualization: Plotly, Dash, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau Big Data: PySpark, Databricks, Snowflake (working) Cloud & DevOps: Azure App Service, Azure Databricks, GitHub

## PROJECTS

AI: Safe Vision (GitHub) Aug 2025 – Present • Built a real-time hazard scoring system to surface under-reported micromobility risks, using a multi-model CV pipeline (detection, segmentation, depth, video) and a FastAPI + Postgres/PostGIS backend with geospatial clustering and hazard-aware routing.

• Shipped a React Native app running ONNX Runtime at 10–15 FPS on device and packaged the stack with

Docker for one-command, reproducible setup.

Agentic AI: Autonomous Code Generation & Debugger (GitHub) Jun 2025 – Sep 2025 • Created a self-debugging code generator that fixes code until tests pass, driven by a docktest repair loop and

compatible with StarCoder2-3B and CodeLlama-7B-Instruct.

• Built a Streamlit UI so users can generate code, inspect logs, and download results without touching the CLI.

SECOM Semiconductor Yield Prediction (GitHub) Apr 2025 – Jul 2025 • Predicted rare wafer failures (~6.6% base rate) with ~75% recall; engineered a leakage-safe pipeline and

trimmed features 590 to 375 to improve robustness.

• Used SHAP to highlight the top 5 sensors influencing failures and ran cost-sensitive analysis to balance false

negatives vs. false positives for fab impact.

Bank Loan Defaulter Prediction (GitHub) Jan 2025 – Mar 2025 • Modeled default risk on 67,463 loans (35 features, ~9.25% defaults) with careful cleaning, encoding, and

outlier control.

• Compared imbalance strategies and models: NearMiss + Random Forest hit ~77% recall; SMOTE + SVC

reached ~51% recall with better balance, reported full precision/recall/AUC.

## EXPERIENCE

Computational Scientist Sep 2019 – Dec 2023 McMaster University Hamilton, Canada

• Built WloopPHI, a Python tool integrated with WIEN2k for Berry-phase and Wilson-loop analysis of Weyl

semimetals, cutting analysis time 60%.

• Ran DFT studies to evaluate thermodynamic stability and topological phases of quantum materials,

contributing to a peer-reviewed publication.

• Developed a Python module for phase-diagram and convex-hull visualization to predict material

stability, supporting screening for quantum-computing relevant materials.

Junior Research Fellow Jun 2016 – Jul 2019 Research Institute, SRM University Chennai, India

• Automated high-throughput DFT workflows for 2D materials screening in Python/Bash on HPCC,

parameter sweeps, batch submission, post-processing, and plotting with reproducible scripts.

• Modeled MoS2/2D heterojunctions and g-C₃N₄ quantum dots; computed band alignment and optoelectronic

properties to support solar-cell and photodetector studies.
